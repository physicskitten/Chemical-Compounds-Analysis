# Project Overview

This project consists of two main components:

## Chemical Formula Parser

A Python function that parses chemical formulas (e.g., `"H2O"`, `"NaCl"`) and returns a dictionary with element symbols as keys and their counts as values.

## Data Analysis Task

Analysis and visualization of data from a CSV file (`dataset_quantemol.csv`), including data cleaning, exploration, and correlation analysis.
